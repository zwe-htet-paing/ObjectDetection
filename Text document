# Real-Time Object Detection

1. You only look once (YOLO)
2. OpenCV

# How YOLO works?

- Traditionally, R-CNN family of algorithms uses regions to localise the object in images
	- High scoring regions of the image are considered as object detected
	
- YOLO follows a completely different approach. It applies a neural network to the entire image to 	 predict bounding boxes and their probabilities
	- High probabilities of the image are considered as object detected
	
# What YOLO can detect?

 Yolo can be applied to
 	1. Image file
 	2. Webcam Feed
 	3. Video File
 	
 Pre-trained YOLOv3 can detect 80 objects, such as:
 	1. Person
 	2. Bicycle
 	3. Car
 	
# How to install YOLO?

- Transfer Learning
	A technique to reuse the weights in one or more layers from a pre-trained network model 		in a new model by
		- keeping the weights
		- fine tuning the weights
		- adapting the weights entirely when training a new model

# Requirements		
 1. Download weight file of YOLO
 2. Download configuration file of YOLO
 3. Download name file - coco
 4. Install OpenCV 3.4.2 or above
